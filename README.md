These are the files used for my barbershop website project. This project encorporates html, css, and javascript to create the front end of this website. The form attached to this website uses
a third party service that takes care of sending the html form to the email listed. This takes care of the back end by sending it to a server which relays it to the specificed email. I have also hosted
this website through aws services as an ec2 instance through the linux platform.
